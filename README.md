## About me
- My Name is Petrescu Alexandru, one of the most common names in Romania, and because of this I really want it to stand for something. What I've chosen is to make the world a better place, in my own way:
- Teach computer science related topics
- Try and explain any concept as many times as required
- Try and achieve maximum result with least effort
- Motivate the others to do the same
- I've been developing since 5th grade and I'm looking for the practical part of any subject
- I'm currently working on my bachelor's in Artificial Intelligence (Sentiment Analysis and Anomaly Detection in Tweets)
- I've been working with .NET for 4 years now and 2 years in production
- I'm teaching SQL Server and Xamarin Forms (my own course)
- After finishing my PhD I will be also a teacher
  

## About this repo
- Since I like the practica stuff, I did not make you read the above for nothing, it is the context of "Why did you do that?" and "Why did you do it that way?"
- Here you will find apps and services that are related to Artificial Intelligence and used with Microsoft Technologies
- There is a high chance that this is or will be presented somewhere so it is in a "Plug and Play" format. Also it might suffer chances after the actual presentation
- As time will pass I will update this repo with more and more content
- Main languages will be: Python and C#
- As Microsoft Technologies, I prefer the right tool for the right job, but in case it just need a simple client, I will go with Xamarin
    

## General Reminder
- Since we are talking about AI/ML the used dataset is the main responsible entity for the results
- Different data produce different results
- Different algorithms over same data produce different results, based on the speciality of the algorithm, in time you will see this on my posts about NLP
